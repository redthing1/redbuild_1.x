# redbuild

super easy containerized builds

## overview

redbuild is a super simple drop-in script enabling software to be built in pre-defined containers. with `podman` installed, any supported project can be built with a single command. projects provide a `build.docker` and `build.sh` for defining the build environment and build steps.

`redbuild.sh`: just add water!

## try the example!

```sh
cd example
../redbuild.sh
```
